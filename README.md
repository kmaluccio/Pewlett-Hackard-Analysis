# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This project uses SQL with postgres and pgAdmin to analyze given employee data to plan ahead for the company. We will determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many new hires the company will need to accommodate to this change.

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. With this information, the manager at Pewlett Hackard can prepare for the 'silver tsunami' as many of their employees reach retirement age.
